# CSC 444 Final Project: Storytelling

## I use game sales data to justify why Microsoft should acquire Activision Blizzard.

For my final project in my Data Visualization class, we had to find our own dataset and use it to tell a story. During this time, Microsoft announced they were acquiring Activision Blizzard and there was pushback from regulators that the deal should
not go through. I decided to make this the focal point of my project.

The first half of this project required a write-up that broke down the story we wanted to tell in three different ways.
 - 3-minute story: If you had only three minutes to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say?
 - Big Idea: The Big Idea boils the so-what down even further: to a single sentence.
 - Storyboard: Visual outline of your data story.

This was written in Storyboard.pdf which can be found in the repository.

The second half of this project consisted of using the data to create visualizations that would support your story. The project required two data visualizations/graphs that answer your question and support your story.

The first visualization is a bar graph and is meant to be more generic and high-level. The bar graph shows that Nintendo And Sony (Microsoft's biggest competitors in the console market) had global sales that doubled and even tripled in comparison
to Microsoft. The graph also had interactivity baked into it as users can hover over each bar to get the specific number of global sales per company.

The second visualization is a line chart and is designed to be more specific and get into more detail on how Sony and Nintendo have dominated the industry while Microsoft was in a distant third place. The line chart shows the total global sales
from 1994 to 2016 for each company. The user has access to a dropdown menu that shows the sales throughout time for each company.
